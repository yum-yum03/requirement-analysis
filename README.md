# Requirement Analysis in Software Development 
this repository documents the requirement analysis of phase for a booking management system, covering key concepts like functional/non-functional requirements, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria.

## What is Requirement Analysis?  
Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and validating user and system needs to define *what* the software must do. It ensures alignment between stakeholders and developers, reducing risks like scope creep.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?  
1. **Prevents Miscommunication**: Clear requirements reduce ambiguities.  
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Prioritizes essential features early.  
3. **Scope Control**: Minimizes unplanned changes during development.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis  
- **Requirement Gathering**: Collect needs via interviews/surveys.  
- **Requirement Elicitation**: Refine needs through prototyping.  
- **Documentation**: Create specs/use cases.  
- **Analysis & Modeling**: Structure requirements (e.g., diagrams).  
- **Validation**: Confirm accuracy with stakeholders.
