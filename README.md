# Requirement Analysis in Software Development 
this repository documents the requirement analysis of phase for a booking management system, covering key concepts like functional/non-functional requirements, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria.

## What is Requirement Analysis?  
Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and validating user and system needs to define *what* the software must do. It ensures alignment between stakeholders and developers, reducing risks like scope creep.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?  
1. **Prevents Miscommunication**: Clear requirements reduce ambiguities.  
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Prioritizes essential features early.  
3. **Scope Control**: Minimizes unplanned changes during development.
